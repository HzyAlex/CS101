# CS101-python
Hey, this is Alex. I am a high school student. I really enjoy coding. This is my Github link showing my side projects.
This Repo include 3 different projects:
1.  Automatically generate Subtitle for movies
2.  NBA game simulation
3.  School athletic games managerment system



## How it works
*Automatically generate Subtitle for movies!*
1. We split the audio file based on the silence with timeflag.
2. Transfer the audio to wav format.
3. Here we call Baidu API to recognize the wav file. Then we can transfrom speech to text. 
4. Generate the subtitle for the movie based on the text timeflag.



## Demo Result

## Further Implementation
For speech recognize, I am trying to implememt a neural network model by myself.
